# Typography

## Typography is architecture

Type communicates hierarchy, density, voice, and scanning order before users read words.

## Role system

Define named roles instead of ad-hoc font sizes. Example:

```text
Display / Brand
Hero / Page Title
Section Title
Subsection Title
Body Strong
Body
Control Label
Metadata
Caption
Code / Monospace
Numeric / Tabular
```

Each role should define family, size, line-height, weight, tracking if needed, and typical context.

## Display typography

Large display type should earn its space. Marketing, editorial, cultural, and expressive work can support extreme scale. Repeated-use utilities, settings, file managers, and dense editors rarely benefit from giant headings consuming the working viewport.

## Line length

Body copy needs readable measure. Do not stretch paragraphs across ultrawide containers. Dense metadata and technical tables may legitimately use shorter or more compact text.

## Numeric alignment

Use tabular numerals for changing metrics, timers, finance, or aligned tables when supported. Preserve unit hierarchy.

## Font loading

On web, avoid blocking or unstable font behavior. On native platforms, prefer system typography unless brand type materially improves identity and is technically safe. Provide fallback stacks.


## HARD expansion — evidence and implementation protocol

Before changing this area, record the actual product behavior, governing components/styles, user frequency, platform conventions, and failure/recovery states. Distinguish a visual preference from an observable usability or coherence problem.

### Decision procedure

1. Identify the user job and current state.
2. Identify what information/action must be recognized first.
3. Trace the code/style/state owner that actually governs the surface.
4. Separate structural, visual, interaction, accessibility, and content issues.
5. Choose the smallest coherent change unless several governing layers are failing together.
6. Implement with the real toolkit rather than screenshot-specific hacks.
7. Verify normal, edge, loading, error, disabled, keyboard/focus, scaling/responsive, and recovery states where relevant.
8. Report observed evidence and remaining unknowns.

### Cross-cutting constraints

- Preserve working behavior and useful platform conventions.
- Do not hide critical state behind color, hover, animation, or decorative media alone.
- Do not introduce generic cards/containers unless they represent a real semantic/interaction boundary.
- Keep product-specific objects and workflow visually stronger than support chrome.
- Respect localization expansion, high-DPI/text scaling, reduced motion, and assistive technology where applicable.
- Avoid unrelated refactors and dependency churn.
- Do not claim PASS for behavior that was not run or observed.

### Runtime checklist

- [ ] Primary job remains discoverable.
- [ ] Primary and destructive actions are distinguishable.
- [ ] Empty/loading/error/disabled/recovery behavior is intentional.
- [ ] Focus/keyboard/input behavior is preserved.
- [ ] Overflow and scaling are handled.
- [ ] Theme and semantic color behavior remain coherent.
- [ ] No fake content, proof, metric, control, or success state was introduced.
- [ ] The rendered result was inspected when the environment permits it.


## ULTRA-HARD deep appendix

When this topic is materially relevant, do not evaluate only the default state. Expand the review across these dimensions:

### State coverage

```text
default
hover / pointer-over (if applicable)
focus-visible
pressed / active
selected / current
disabled / unavailable
loading / pending
empty / zero-data
partial / stale
success / completion
warning / risk
error / failure
offline / disconnected
permission denied / limited
read-only / locked
long content / localization
narrow / constrained
wide / high-density
reduced motion
high contrast / forced colors
```

### Input coverage

Check each relevant input independently: mouse/pointer, keyboard, touch, stylus, controller/remote, assistive technology, and automation/API-driven state. Never assume that a path reachable by hover or precise pointer is reachable by every other input.

### Responsive / adaptive coverage

Record what changes at narrow, standard, wide, ultrawide, high-text-scale, and long-content conditions. Reordering, collapsing, cropping, scroll ownership, navigation model, inspector behavior, command availability, and motion complexity may change independently.

### Evidence standard

Runtime observation outranks inference. A static code path can show intent but not prove visible focus, hit target behavior, animation timing, scroll containment, package/runtime assets, or assistive technology behavior. Report `BLOCKED` when the target environment cannot be exercised.

### Root-cause test

Before adding another local override, ask whether the issue belongs to a governing token, component contract, layout primitive, state model, navigation model, or content structure. Fix the highest stable layer that explains the failure without rewriting unrelated logic.

### Stop condition

Stop when acceptance criteria are met, must-preserve behavior remains correct, high-impact in-scope failures are resolved, and further change would add more churn or decorative novelty than user value.
